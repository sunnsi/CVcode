# Abstract
In the CVcode project, we employ the finite difference method to solve partial differential equations, considering both scenarios with and without the MSIS assumption. Our code generates scattered data for peak current density ($I_{pc}$), based on varying diffusion coefficients ($D_s$), electrode radius ($R_0$), and MSIS parameters ($C_{max}$). We then fit this data to the analytical formula for $I_{pc}$ derived in our article, using the differential evolution method. Finally, we compare the scattered data with the corresponding formula, both with and without the MSIS assumption, to validate the accuracy of our results.
